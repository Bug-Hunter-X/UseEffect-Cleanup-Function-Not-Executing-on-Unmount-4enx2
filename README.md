# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with React's `useEffect` hook where the cleanup function doesn't execute properly on component unmount.  This can lead to memory leaks or unexpected side effects.

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook's cleanup function is essential for releasing resources when a component is unmounted. In this example, the cleanup function logs a message, but it might not always be called, leading to debugging challenges.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the component is properly unmounted and investigating potential issues that might prevent the cleanup function from being executed. Common causes include early returns or errors within the component itself.
